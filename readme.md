* Detailed Explaination of Our Project Idea:  
                1. Our idea is about creating a supply chain optimisation as well as a resource management system using a full-fledged web application to address the demand of Covid resources.<br/> 
                2. It will serve for urgent medical essentials and services such as availability of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, blood & plasma donors, medicines, etc.  
                3. Using our Chat Application, we aim to create a helping community in these harsh times.<br/> 

* The problem it Solves / Solutions Provided : 
        In these hard times of the pandemic, many people have lost their loving ones. There are many people, who after their Covid Recovery, are ready to donate Covid Resources. Our idea revolves around solving this problem. Our community will bridge the gap between the people who are in dire need of help and the ones who are willing to donate.<br/> 
        The major problems/challenges our project addresses are :<br/> 
        1. There are many people who are in dire need of urgent medical resources, especially during this pandemic situation. But it becomes quite difficult for them to find those people who are willing to donate these resources. So, our main objective is to bridge the gap between the willing donor and the needy by creating a community where they can connect and help each other.<br/> 
        2. We will also be ensuring to facilitate the exchange between them, by providing on-time delivery and transportation of these resources.<br/> 
        3. Our application will also provide real time availability of oxygen refill centres and nearby hospital beds for emergency requirements.<br/> 

* How it Works? :<br/> 
                1. Web Scraping is used to collect data of both the willing donors and the people in need.  
                2. Using Automation, an automated message is sent to all the users, containing the link of our Chat Application. <br/> 
                3. Using our Chat application, people can communicate with each other in real-time. Their essential data is also stored securely. <br/> 
                4. Finally, our CoviCure Website displays the data of all the donors. It also addresses Supply Chain Optimisation and Resource Management Services such as Nearby Oxygen Refill Centres and Hospital Beds availability. <br/>  

* Real-Time Usage of Project : <br/> 
        Fully-Fledged and Completely Independent Application that can be used by any Individual or ant Organisation for the Betterment of the Society<br/>
